# DeepStyleX

**DeepStyleX** is an image transformation family of models that applies a style to the image.
This model is inspired from these two papers: 

- [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155)
- [Instance Normalization: The Missing Ingredient for Fast Stylization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08022)


## Getting started
